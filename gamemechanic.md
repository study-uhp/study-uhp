## Game mechanics
The application will run on a game mechanic that will help ICS students and encourage face to face meetings in ICSpace. There are two roles assigned to each user: sensei, and grasshopper. 
## Rating system
There will be a rating system for both sensei’s and grasshoppers. That means that each user has a different rating for each of their roles. 
#### The rating system for sensei will determine:
- Their dependability (If they show up or not). (1/5)
- Their ability to teach/tutor. (1/5)
- If their lesson, or study session was helpful. (1/5)
- If their lesson, was accurate. (1/5)
- And finally, “Would you receive help from this person again?” (1/5)
#### The rating system for the grasshopper will determine:
- Their dependability (if they show up or not). (1/5)
- On whether they displayed interest in the topic. (Trying to get the solution without doing the work or understanding the concept). (2/5)
- And finally, “Would you help this person again?” (2/5)

 After each session, sensei’s will rate their grasshoppers. And grasshoppers will rate their sensei’s. We can use a checkbox to make it simpler. For the sensei rating system each bullet point represents 1 star out of 5. And for the grasshopper rating system each bullet point represents 2 stars out of 5 except for the dependability.
 
 Listed above, if you show up you can get a point. We will give everyone a grace period to delete their session. So, if something comes up, they may cancel or delete their participation to a session. But if they don’t, they will automatically get a 0/5.
 
 To find the rating of a user:
 - amountOfStarsEarned / numberOfSessions
 
 Each user will have 3 separate rankings. One that resets every week, one that resets every month, and one that resets every semester. This will be further explained in rewards.
 
 ## Ranking system
 
 There will be a ranking system for sensei’s that will determine their performance. There will be a ranking for the week, month, and semester. 
 
 #### Weekly ranking:
 
 To get the ranking for the week, we need to calculate the amount of points they have for the week.  To find this :
 - weeklyRating * amountOfSessionsTutored
 
 Ex. Suppose a sensei taught 10 sessions. Their weekly rating was 4.5 stars out of 5.
 - 4.5stars * 10sessions
 
 Giving the sensei a weekly score of 45 points. The leaderboard will rank the users according to their scores.
 
 #### Monthly ranking:
 
 To get the ranking for the month, we need to calculate the amount of points they have for the month. To find this :
 - weeklyRating * amountOfSessionsTutored
 
 Ex. Suppose a sensei taught 50 sessions. Their monthly rating was 3 stars out of 5.
 - 3stars * 50sessions
 
 Giving the sensei a monthly score of 150 points. Again, the leaderboard will rank the users according to their scores.
 
 ####Semester ranking:
 To get the ranking for the semester, we need to calculate the amount of points they have for the semester. To find this : 
 - semesterRating * amountofSessionsTutored
 
 Ex. Suppose a sensei taught 220 sessions for the semester. Their monthly rating was 3.8 stars out of 5.
 - 3.8stars * 220sessions
 
 Giving the sensei a score of 836 points. The leaderboard will rank the users according to their score.
 
 ##Anti-cheat problem
 
 If two students decided that they wanted to cheat the system, it would be easy to do so. All they would have to do, is get a bunch of sessions and rating each other 5 out of 5 stars multiple times a day, for the whole semester. To block this from happening, we will have a warning for people who make accounts. The rules are simple. After every session, the grasshopper must rate their sensei, and submit proof of their study session. It could be anything that proves that they did work together. This can be done by screenshots of the assignment, pictures of anything they wrote down. Even a zip file containing the assignment they worked on. By doing this, they can also cheat the system, but it deters people from just sitting around in the room. 
 
 Another way to deter people from sitting around and cheating the system is by having a check in inside of ICSpace, that will require everyone to login and enter a new code to prove that they really joined the session. The code will be reset daily and posted in ICSpace.
 
 There will also be a feature for the students that are not in a session. They can report people attempting to cheat the system, by asking that you submit evidence to an admin. Under the sessions tab you may click on the session that is in progress and there will be a report fraudulent session button. After clicking that, it will send you to a link that will allow you to email/message an admin. It will ask for photo evidence, and a brief description of what you saw. As an incentive for reporting fraudulent sessions, the user that reported will receive points as a reward.
 
 If a student is caught cheating the system, admins will have the ability to void the session, suspend the account from joining the sessions for two weeks, and take away points depending on the case.
 
 ##Reward system
 
 The reward system is simple. There will be a reward every week, month, and semester. Every user has three ratings:
 - Weekly ratings reset every week.
 - Monthly ratings reset every month.
 - Semester ratings reset every semester.
 
 At the ending of each week the system will pull the top person on the leaderboard for the week. That person will be sent an email saying that they were the top for the week, and they can pick up a $20 gift card from ________. 
 
 At the end of each month the reward is $100.
 
 At the end of the semester there will be rewards for the top 3 sensei.
 
## To make the game fair

For some users, they will look at the leaderboard for the semester and decide that there is no point because there are people that have more time to teach. For those users, there will also be another reward for people on the weekly leaderboard.

Top 10 sensei for each week will be given extra points as a reward for teaching a lot of students that week.

Ex. If you scored first place, you would earn 10 points towards your semester points. Second place would earn 9. Third place would earn 8, Etc.

This catch up mechanic would encourage people to not give up halfway through the week if they saw the leaderboard and got discouraged.

##Other
Incentives for grasshoppers, is that they get free tutoring at any time they want. The rating system for grasshoppers is simply for the sensei to decide if they want to help the user or not. This will keep the grasshoppers engaged, because if their score gets too low no one will want to help them.
